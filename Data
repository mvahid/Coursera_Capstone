The Battle of the Neighborhoods - Week 1
Data :
Two cities will be analysed in this project : Manhattan and Downtown Toronto.

I will be using the below 2 datasets for analysing Manhattan and Downtown Toronto.
1.https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset
2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
3.http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data/Geospatial_Coordinates.csv




Data 1 : Neighborhood has a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. 
In order to segement the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and 
the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the the latitude and logitude coordinates of each neighborhood.

2.For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and
cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and
then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.
Once the data is in a structured format, you can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and 
cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.

3. This file has the geocodes of Toronto.
