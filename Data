The Battle of the Neighborhoods - Week 1
Data :
Two cities will be analysed in this project : Manhattan and Downtown Toronto.

I will be using the below 2 datasets for analysing Manhattan and Downtown Toronto.
1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
2.http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data/Geospatial_Coordinates.csv
3.https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset



Data 3 : Neighborhood has a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. 
In order to segement the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and 
the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the the latitude and logitude coordinates of each neighborhood.
